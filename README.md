ML Practice Projects

This repository is a work-in-progress collection of machine learning practice projects.
It serves as a sandbox for experimenting with different ideas, models, and workflows.

The purpose of this repo is to:

Provide a central space for building, testing, and learning.

Keep projects organized by topic/area while they are under development.

Allow rapid iteration before projects become mature enough for their own dedicated repo.

📂 Repository Structure

Each folder inside this repo represents a separate project or experiment.

Projects may range from small exercises to larger end-to-end applications.

Some folders may only contain notebooks and scratch code during early stages.

Over time, these will evolve into structured projects.

Example structure:

ml-practice-projects/
│
├── project-1-name/   # Early-stage experiment
├── project-2-name/   # More developed prototype
├── project-3-name/   # End-to-end pipeline
│
└── README.md         # You are here

🚀 Roadmap

Projects will start here in this repo.

Once a project becomes complete and polished, it will:

Be moved into its own dedicated repository.

Receive standalone documentation, tests, and deployment (if applicable).

This keeps the root repo lightweight and experimental, while mature work moves to separate repos for clarity.

🛠️ Status

Currently active development in progress.

Expect frequent changes, refactors, and reorganizations.
